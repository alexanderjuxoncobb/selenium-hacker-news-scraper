The project was initiated by the original contributor of **workout.lol**, who aimed to address the challenges faced by the previous platform, particularly issues with exercise video partnerships that led to its abandonment. The new platform supports **Node.js 18+** and can be deployed via **Docker** or a manual **PostgreSQL** setup, with installation commands like `pnpm install` and `make init` for ease of use. Future enhancements include a mobile app, gamification features, and integration with wearables, emphasizing a community-driven approach to revitalize fitness tools. The contributor emphasizes, \"This isn't just a revival; it's an evolution,\" inviting developers and fitness enthusiasts to engage with the project through contributions and suggestions.",

It highlights the challenge of sharing sensitive documents without exposing their contents to sync servers, proposing homomorphic encryption as a solution. Using the TFHE-rs library, a Rust implementation, the author demonstrates a basic example of adding two encrypted integers, showcasing that operations on encrypted data yield results identical to those performed on plaintext. The article emphasizes that while homomorphic encryption allows computations on encrypted data, it remains computationally intensive, limiting its current practical applications. Key insights include the potential for enhanced privacy in collaborative applications and the need for further optimization in homomorphic encryption to achieve usability in production environments.",

E.g. you could only map notes of a certain scale and range in order to save space.\nIf you consider building something custom; I have found that outputting to hardware MIDI from an Arduino is delightfully simple.

Citing Kwa et al. (2025) from METR, the article notes that the task length AI can handle doubles every 7 months, based on a suite of 170 tasks, with a 50% success rate achievable for tasks up to 59 minutes but only 15 minutes for an 80% success rate. The findings suggest that each agent has a \"half-life\" defined by the time it takes a human to complete tasks, highlighting a critical insight: \"the task length for an 80% success rate is 1/4 the task length for a 50% success rate.\" This model invites further exploration of AI capabilities across diverse tasks, while acknowledging limitations in generalizability.",
