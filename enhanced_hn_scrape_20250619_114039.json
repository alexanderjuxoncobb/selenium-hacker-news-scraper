It supports multiple plans—Pro (~7,000 tokens), Max5 (~35,000), and Max20 (~140,000)—and includes an auto-detection mode that switches to a custom limit when the Pro threshold is exceeded. Users can customize reset times and time zones, with default reset times set for every 5 hours after the first message in a session. The tool can be installed using Python 3.6+ and npm, with a simple command like `./ccusage_monitor.py --plan pro` for basic usage. As stated in the article, \"Start Early: Begin monitoring when you start a new session\" is a key actionable insight for effective management of token usage.",

For instance, an LLM can classify resumes as \"Passed\" or \"Failed\" using one-shot prompting, while RAG enhances this by integrating internal data for improved decision-making. Key insights include starting with simple workflows and only adopting AI agents when necessary, as well as prioritizing reliability over capability in production systems. Notably, the article suggests employing APIs for automation, such as connecting to email and calendar services to streamline recruitment processes.",

This initiative includes the construction of seven semiconductor fabs across mega-sites in Texas and Utah, which will create over 60,000 jobs. TI's Sherman site alone will see up to $40 billion allocated for four fabs (SM1, SM2, SM3, and SM4), with SM1 and SM2 already in progress. CEO Haviv Ilan stated, “TI is building dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity at scale,” emphasizing the critical role these chips play in various sectors, from automotive to healthcare. Partnerships with leading companies such as Apple, Ford, Medtronic, NVIDIA, and SpaceX highlight TI's commitment to driving innovation in American manufacturing and technology.",

      "article_summary": "Israeli developer Maor Shlomo's vibe-coding startup, Base44, was acquired by Wix for $80 million just six months after its launch. Despite being a bootstrapped venture, Base44 rapidly grew to 250,000 users, generating $189,000 in profit by May, largely through word-of-mouth and Shlomo's social media presence. The platform enables users to create applications without coding by utilizing text prompts and supports various integrations, including email and analytics. Shlomo attributed the sale to the need for scaling beyond organic growth, stating, \"the scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into,\" highlighting the potential of AI in startup productivity.",

It has no display, instead opting for XR display glasses.\nThe internals are the main board, cooler, and battery from a Steam Deck OLED. I bought the parts separately rather than gutting a perfectly good one.\nThe link is to the CAD files. I decided to open source it as I explore building a better one.\nFeel free to jump straight to that, here's the origin story for anyone interested:\nI started using the XREAL glasses a few months ago. they're great, easily my favorite \"XR\" product. It's built around the one killer app of XR, a virtual display. shedding all non-essential hardware into a small, lightweight package.\nbut I hate the redundancy. Whatever device I'm using it with, the built in screen goes unused. In parallel, I've also found myself extremely disappointed in each product calling itself a \"spatial computer\" despite being nothing but an overweight iPad for your face.\nI wanted a real computer designed to be used with these glasses, and in the smallest package I could possibly achieve.\nSo I grabbed an actual iPad, downloaded Shapr3D and got to work. My iteration process involved jumping back and forth between my iPad and a 3D printer. I went through roughly 15 failed iterations getting the screw mounts, airflow, and ergonomics just right.\nThe final result is what I believe to be a true spatial computer. I've been daily driving and I'm pretty happy with the experience. It's currently running Ubuntu 24, but I may switch back to Steam OS, given it's better optimized for the hardware.",

It includes a hidden command for generating manpages using Mango, which enhances the appearance of documentation by utilizing roff instead of markdown. The library allows for customizable themes, supports silent usage output to improve user experience, and is easy to implement with a simple invocation of `fang.Execute` alongside a Cobra command. As part of the Charm ecosystem, Fang is open-source under the MIT license, inviting community feedback and contributions via platforms like Twitter and Discord.",

It uses Clap which is the equivalent of Cobra; though I don’t think Clap has the same kind of fancy output?\nThroughout these years, I have found that cross-compiling is the most challenging part of creating a CLI. When you are building a web back-end, you control the execution environment (usually linux). For CLIs, your users could be on Linux, macOS or Windows. You need to get three x2 binaries (so a total of 6) to have a fair coverage.\nI’ve tried cross, but for Windows and macOS you need licenses. There is no straightforward way to give your users Docker images and have them running in a few commands. You can compile on GitHub action machines, but that’s a very slow feedback loop. I wonder if things are better in Go land.\n!: https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter",
