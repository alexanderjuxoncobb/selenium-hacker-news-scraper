Built on Fly.io, Phoenix.new operates in an ephemeral virtual machine, providing root shell access that allows agents to install packages and run programs without affecting the local environment. It features a headless Chrome browser for real-time interaction with applications, enabling the agent to autonomously build full-stack applications, including those using WebSockets and databases. McCord emphasizes that Phoenix.new can significantly reduce deployment times, citing Andrej Karpathy's week-long struggle to launch an app, which Phoenix.new aims to minimize. The tool supports integration with GitHub and is poised to shift developer workflows towards more automated, agent-driven processes.",

AI to help you create an app using the Phoenix web framework for Elixir?\n- Does \"Phoenix.new\" require the app to be hosted/deployed on Fly.io? If that's the case, maybe a naming like \"phoenix.flyio.new\" would be better and extensible for any type of service Fly.io helps in deployment - Phoenix/Elixir being one)\n- Is it all 3 above?\nAnd how does this compare to Tidewave.ai (created as presumably you know, by Elixir creator)\nApologies if I'm possibility conflating topics here.",

It has been weird trying to position/brand this as we started out just going for full-stack Elixir/Phoenix and it became very clear this is already much bigger than a single stack. That said, we wanted to nail a single stack super well to start and the agent is tailored for vibe'd apps atm. I want to introduce a pair mode next for more leveled assistance without having to nag it.\nYou could absolutely treat phoenix.new as your full dev IDE environment, but I think about it less an IDE, and more a remote runtime where agents get work done that you pop into as needed. Or another way to think about it, the agent doesn't care or need the vscode IDE or xterm. They are purely conveniences for us meaty humans.\nFor me, something like this is the future of programming. Agents fiddling away and we pop in to see what's going on or work on things they aren't well suited for.\nTidewave is focused on improving your local dev experience while we sit on the infra/remote agent/codex/devin/jules side of the fence. Tidewave also has a MCP server which Phoenix.new could integrate with that runs inside your app itself.",

                  "text": "> In economics, the Jevons paradox (/ËˆdÊ’É›vÉ™nz/; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use (thereby reducing the amount needed for a single application); however, as the cost of using the resource drops, if the price is highly elastic, this results in overall demand increasing, causing total resource consumption to rise. Governments have typically expected efficiency gains to lower resource consumption, rather than anticipating possible increases due to the Jevons paradox.[1]\nI do think there will be some Jevons effect going on with this, but I think it's important to recognize that software development as a resource is different than something like coal. For example, if the average iPhone-only teenager can now suddenly start cranking out apps, that may ultimately increase demand for apps and there may be more code than ever getting \"written,\" but there won't necesarily be a need for your CS-grad software engineer anymore, so we could still be fucked. Why would you pay a high salary for a SWE when your business teams can just generate whatever app they need without having to know anything about how it actually works?\nI think the arguments about \"AI isn't good enough to replace senior engineers\" will hold true for a few years, but not much beyond that. Jevon's Paradox will probably hold true for software as a resource, but not for SWEs as a resource. In the coal scenario, imagine that coal gets super cheap to procure because we invent robots that can do it from alpha to omega. Coal demand may go up, but the job for the coal miner is toast, and unless that coal miner has ownership stake, they will be out on their ass.\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox",

The example I wanna work on soon is telling Siri I want my iPhone to work as a touchpad for my computer and have the necessary drivers for that to happen be built automatically because thatâ€™s a reasonable thing I could expect my hardware to do. Thatâ€™s the sort of thing that seems pretty achievable by AI in a couple turns that would take a single dev a year or two. And the thing is, I canâ€™t imagine a software dev that doesnâ€™t have some set of skills that are still applicable in this future, either through general CS skills (knowing whatâ€™s within reasonable expectations of hardware, being able to effectively describe more specific behavior/choosing the right abstractions etc) or other more nebulous technical knowledge (e.g. what you want to do with hardware in the first place).\nAnother thing I will mention is that for things like the iPhone example from earlier, there are usually a lot of optimizations or decisions involved that are derived from the userâ€™s experience as a human which the LLM canâ€™t really use synthetically. As another example if I turned my phone into a second monitor the LLM might generate code that sends full resolution images to the phone when the phoneâ€™s screen is much lower, thereâ€™s no real point for it to optimize that away if it doesnâ€™t know how eyes work and what screens are used for. So at some point it needs to involve a model of a human, at least for examples like these.",

The top 10% of engineers I think will be just fine for the reasons you've said, but at the lower levels it will be a blood bath (and realistically maybe it should as there are plenty of SWEs that probably shouldn't be writing code that matters, but that feels like a separate discussion). Your point about other skills/knowledge is good too, though I suspect most white collar jobs are on the chopping block too, just maybe shortly behind.\nYour future is one that I'm dreaming about too (although I have a hard time believing Apple would allow you to do that, but on Android or some future 3rd option it might be possible). Especially as a Linux user there have been plenty of times I've thought of cool stuff that I'd love to have personally that would take me months of work to build (time I've accepted I'll never have until my kids are all out of the house at least haha). I'm also dreaming of a day when I can just ask the AI to produce more seasons of Star Trek TOS, Have Gun - Will Travel, The Lieutenant, and many other great shows that I'm hungry for more, and have it crank them out. That future would be incredible!\nBut that feels like the smooth side of the sword, and avoiding a deep cut from the sharp side feels increasingly important. Hopefully it will solve itself but seeing the impacts so far I'm getting worried.\nI appreciate the discussion and optimism! There is too much AI doomerism out there and the upsides (like you've mentioned) don't get talked about enough I think.",
