They use a 3rd party for alerting and dashboarding, and that 3rd party went down, but RedPanda still had their own monitoring.\nWhen I read \"major outage for a large part of the internet was just another normal day for Redpanda Cloud customers\", I expected a brave tale of RedPanda SREs valiantly fixing things, or some cool automatic failover tech. What I got instead was: Google told RedPanda there was an issue, RedPanda had a look and their service was unaffected, nothing needed failing over, then someone at RedPanda wrote an article bragging about their triple-nine uptime & fault tolerance.\nI get it, an SRE is doing well if you don't notice them, but the only real preventative measure I saw here that directly helped with this issue, is that they over provision disk space. Which I'd be alarmed if they didn't do.",

Key insights include a dramatic 20× increase in event volume managed with less than 10% of the CPU previously required, achieved by developing a custom pipeline that addressed inefficiencies in OpenTelemetry (OTel), which was unable to scale effectively. The introduction of HyperDX, a ClickHouse-native observability UI, allowed for enhanced exploration and root-cause analysis, transitioning from a Grafana-based UI to a more integrated ClickStack observability stack. The article emphasizes the importance of specialized tools for high-throughput scenarios, noting that \"the real gold lies in its system tables,\" which capture crucial operational insights beyond standard output.",

With a lightweight footprint of just 250kB, Edit features a user-friendly text-driven UI, modeless operation, and essential functionalities like Find and Replace (supporting regex), word wrap, and file encoding options. It aims to provide a familiar experience for VS Code users by sharing keybindings, making it easier for them to transition from traditional editors like Vim or Nano. While lacking advanced features like syntax highlighting, Edit is positioned for speed and simplicity, with future enhancements planned. To install it on Ubuntu, users can download the binary from GitHub or use the unofficial snap package with the command `sudo snap install msedit`.",

The lack of transparency regarding AppCloud's privacy practices violates GDPR and local data protection laws, prompting an open letter to Samsung demanding clear disclosure of data handling, an effective opt-out mechanism, and a reconsideration of future pre-installations. The letter emphasizes that \"users deserve to know what is installed on their devices and how their data is being used,\" especially in light of regional privacy rights.",

For the same reason to bother with surgical assassinations if you can blanket entire regions with nuclear fireballs. Radioactive wastelands are unprofitable! This is a general problem with genocide: it only gets you land, and since the Green Revolution land is abundant. Protection rackets, on the otehr hand, are highly profitable, but only with some exclusivity; if extortionists multiply, the unique Nash equilibrium is multiple gangs that collectively demand many times the victims' total revenues, resulting in ecological collapse.\nMore generally, the threat of violence is only effective as a form of coercion when you can credibly withdraw the violence as a reward for compliance. Violence provides no incentive to comply to someone who believes they are just as likely to be a victim whether they comply or not.\nBut swarms of autonomous seek-and-destroy explosives are plausibly the most effective way to provide that surgical-assassination threat, perhaps combined with poisons, solid penetrators, and/or incendiaries. The Minority Report spiders (not yet technically feasible) or a quadcopter can be enormously more selective than a GBU-57, a Hellfire missile, or even a hand grenade, and can choose to avert their attack at the last millisecond upon the presentation of properly signed do-not-assassinate orders, even if long-distance communication is jammed.",

This \"video-book\" includes four parts covering topics such as enumerative combinatorics and orthogonal polynomials, with courses designed for both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers. The website allows users to navigate the videos interactively, linking directly to specific lecture points, thus overcoming common video limitations. As Viennot states, \"the emphasis of the course being on the bijective point of view in combinatorics,\" the resource combines visual mathematics with modern technology, making it a valuable tool for those in mathematics, physics, and computer science. For citation, one can reference the parts similarly to books, e.g., \"The Art of Bijective Combinatorics, Part II, IMSc",

He states, \"Lisp's cons is perhaps the greatest fuck up in the history of computer languages,\" highlighting its historical entrenchment in Lisp for over four decades and the resulting complications in list processing. Lee suggests actionable improvements, such as establishing standards for \"proper lists\" and marking cons-related constructs as obsolete, drawing on examples from languages like Racket and Clojure, which have addressed these limitations. He emphasizes that while simple list usage is common, the cumbersome nature of cons becomes problematic in more complex applications, particularly as programming paradigms evolve.",

It had lambda decades before other languages figured out it was a good idea, but it had set! for just as long.\nIt is also not a list based language, but a tree based one. The fundamental point of lisps is that you can manipulate the abstract syntax tree directly since it's pretty much the same thing as the parse tree.\n>Deep Nesting is Rare\n>The lisp's cons [...] works just fine when data structure used is simple. [...] vast majority of list usage is just simple flat list, sometimes 2 level of nesting [...] 3 levels of nesting is seldom used [...] Greater than 3 level is rarely seen. Systematic manipulation and exploitation of nested list, such as mapping to leafs, to particular level, transposition by permutation on level, or list structure pattern matching in today's functional langs, etc is hardly ever to be seen.\nI guess the author has never used lisp to implement a DSL in lisp. Writing a lisp interpreted in lisp is the first real program you write if you take a lisp course at university and you need to handle arbitrarily nested expressions.\nReal world usage also involves writing a specialist language to solve your problem for anything more complex than a utility script, e.g. Emacs is a text editing DSL implemented in elisp.",

Built on Fly.io, Phoenix.new operates in an ephemeral virtual machine, providing root shell access that allows agents to install packages and run programs without affecting the local environment. It features a headless Chrome browser for real-time interaction with applications, enabling the agent to autonomously build full-stack applications, including those using WebSockets and databases. McCord emphasizes that Phoenix.new can significantly reduce deployment times, citing Andrej Karpathy's week-long struggle to launch an app, which Phoenix.new aims to minimize. The tool supports integration with GitHub and is poised to shift developer workflows towards more automated, agent-driven processes.",

AI to help you create an app using the Phoenix web framework for Elixir?\n- Does \"Phoenix.new\" require the app to be hosted/deployed on Fly.io?

I want to introduce a pair mode next for more leveled assistance without having to nag it.\nYou could absolutely treat phoenix.new as your full dev IDE environment, but I think about it less an IDE, and more a remote runtime where agents get work done that you pop into as needed. Or another way to think about it, the agent doesn't care or need the vscode IDE or xterm. They are purely conveniences for us meaty humans.\nFor me, something like this is the future of programming. Agents fiddling away and we pop in to see what's going on or work on things they aren't well suited for.\nTidewave is focused on improving your local dev experience while we sit on the infra/remote agent/codex/devin/jules side of the fence.

                  "text": "> In economics, the Jevons paradox (/ˈdʒɛvənz/; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use (thereby reducing the amount needed for a single application); however, as the cost of using the resource drops, if the price is highly elastic, this results in overall demand increasing, causing total resource consumption to rise. Governments have typically expected efficiency gains to lower resource consumption, rather than anticipating possible increases due to the Jevons paradox.[1]\nI do think there will be some Jevons effect going on with this, but I think it's important to recognize that software development as a resource is different than something like coal. For example, if the average iPhone-only teenager can now suddenly start cranking out apps, that may ultimately increase demand for apps and there may be more code than ever getting \"written,\" but there won't necesarily be a need for your CS-grad software engineer anymore, so we could still be fucked. Why would you pay a high salary for a SWE when your business teams can just generate whatever app they need without having to know anything about how it actually works?\nI think the arguments about \"AI isn't good enough to replace senior engineers\" will hold true for a few years, but not much beyond that. Jevon's Paradox will probably hold true for software as a resource, but not for SWEs as a resource. In the coal scenario, imagine that coal gets super cheap to procure because we invent robots that can do it from alpha to omega. Coal demand may go up, but the job for the coal miner is toast, and unless that coal miner has ownership stake, they will be out on their ass.\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox",

The example I wanna work on soon is telling Siri I want my iPhone to work as a touchpad for my computer and have the necessary drivers for that to happen be built automatically because that’s a reasonable thing I could expect my hardware to do. That’s the sort of thing that seems pretty achievable by AI in a couple turns that would take a single dev a year or two. And the thing is, I can’t imagine a software dev that doesn’t have some set of skills that are still applicable in this future, either through general CS skills (knowing what’s within reasonable expectations of hardware, being able to effectively describe more specific behavior/choosing the right abstractions etc) or other more nebulous technical knowledge (e.g. what you want to do with hardware in the first place).\nAnother thing I will mention is that for things like the iPhone example from earlier, there are usually a lot of optimizations or decisions involved that are derived from the user’s experience as a human which the LLM can’t really use synthetically. As another example if I turned my phone into a second monitor the LLM might generate code that sends full resolution images to the phone when the phone’s screen is much lower, there’s no real point for it to optimize that away if it doesn’t know how eyes work and what screens are used for. So at some point it needs to involve a model of a human, at least for examples like these.",

The top 10% of engineers I think will be just fine for the reasons you've said, but at the lower levels it will be a blood bath (and realistically maybe it should as there are plenty of SWEs that probably shouldn't be writing code that matters, but that feels like a separate discussion). Your point about other skills/knowledge is good too, though I suspect most white collar jobs are on the chopping block too, just maybe shortly behind.\nYour future is one that I'm dreaming about too (although I have a hard time believing Apple would allow you to do that, but on Android or some future 3rd option it might be possible). Especially as a Linux user there have been plenty of times I've thought of cool stuff that I'd love to have personally that would take me months of work to build (time I've accepted I'll never have until my kids are all out of the house at least haha). I'm also dreaming of a day when I can just ask the AI to produce more seasons of Star Trek TOS, Have Gun - Will Travel, The Lieutenant, and many other great shows that I'm hungry for more, and have it crank them out. That future would be incredible!\nBut that feels like the smooth side of the sword, and avoiding a deep cut from the sharp side feels increasingly important. Hopefully it will solve itself but seeing the impacts so far I'm getting worried.\nI appreciate the discussion and optimism! There is too much AI doomerism out there and the upsides (like you've mentioned) don't get talked about enough I think.",

            "article_summary": "YouTube is currently A/B testing anti-adblock measures, including a technique called \"fake buffering,\" where the video playback is delayed by 80% of the ad duration, effectively wasting time for users who block ads. This buffering occurs on the initial video request from InnerTube's /youtubei/v1/player endpoint, which is crucial for fetching video data, and is exacerbated by the proprietary SABR (Server ABR) protocol that aims to optimize streaming. A workaround for users is to set the `isInlinePlaybackNoAd` property to true in the JSON requests, which can be implemented using a filter in uBlock Origin. Notably, the filter can be created by hooking into Object.assign instead of JSON.stringify to bypass a newly introduced locker script that prevents modifications to global objects, as detailed by the author who utilized the req2proto tool to extract relevant Protocol Buffers definitions.",

That’s not to say whether or not the advertisement is for a product or service for which the viewer is interested in purchasing but how it relates to the context in which it is viewed.\nPeople complain about billboards next to a countryside highway because it is entirely irrelevant to driving through the countryside. Actual complaints may be about how the billboards block a scenic view but that also seems like another way of complaining about the irrelevance. Similarly, if I am watching a Youtube video, I am never thinking that a disruptive message from a commercial business is relevant to my current activities (uh, passivities?). No advertisement is relevant, not even in-video direct sponsorships, hence SponsorBlock.\nIf I go to Costco and see an advertisement for tires... well, I’m at Costco, where I buy stuff. Things are sold at Costco and people go there to have things sold to them. I might need tires and realize I can get that taken care of while I’m at Costco. Nearly every advertisement I see at Costco is relevant because it’s selling something I can buy in the same building, indeed usually something juxtaposed close to the advertisement.\nI don’t complain about advertisements at Costco because that would be insane. I complain about the advertisements on Youtube because they’re irrelevant and weird but somehow normalized.",

But even then we already have official roadsigns that only show logos and are otherwise relatively unobtrusive. Similar ones for fast food, actually.\nSuch signs seem agreeable given there is some relevance (I legitimately might be low on gas/battery charge/food satiation levels in a context which I am actually likely to have a specific product need from one or more of the advertised businesses) and they are small enough to be ignorable when they are not actually relevant. The biggest issue I think about with that is how a business gets themselves on the sign but it’s probably not that hard once they are operating next to a highway exit.\n(I loathe advertisements, so when I say “agreeable” I mean something like “not wholly disagreeable”.)",

Despite achieving a 69.6% F1-score on the AbsenceBench tasks with an average context length of 5,000 tokens, even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet struggle significantly due to the limitations of Transformer attention mechanisms in recognizing \"gaps\" in documents. The benchmark tests LLMs across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests, highlighting a critical distinction between tasks where models excel (e.g., Needle in a Haystack) and those where they falter. The research underscores the need for improved model architectures to better handle information omissions.",

We're feeding correct answers to specific, individual examples which promotes memoization.\nWhat we should be doing in post training is ditch direct backpropagation on next token, instead let the model finish its wrong answer, append explanation why it's wrong and continue backpropagation for final answer - now with explanation in context to guide it to the right place in understanding.\nWhat all of this means is that current models are largely underutilized and unnecessarily bloated, they contain way too much memoized information. Making model larger is easy, quick illusion of improvement. Models need to be squeezed more, more focus needs to go towards training flow itself.",

First there is naive memoization, followed by more examples until you get it.\nJust nitpicking here, but this isn't how humans learn numbers. They start at birth with competency up to about 3 or 5 and expand from that. So they can already work with quantities of varying size (i.e. they know which is more, the 4 apples on the left or the five on the right, and they also know what happens if I take one apple from the left and put it to the others on the right), and then they learn the numbers. So yes, they learn the numbers through memorization, but only the signs/symbols, not the numeric competency itself.",

The article cites that Earth's total living biomass is approximately 550 billion tons, a minuscule fraction compared to the Earth's total mass, which underscores the rarity of life. The piece challenges the notion of life as merely a byproduct of planetary processes, urging a reconsideration of its unique value in the universe.",

Life significantly expands the surface area of the planet capable of absorbing energy, exchanging gases and performing complex chemical reactions. The Earth-sys­tem scientist Tyler Volk has calculated that all the plant roots on Earth, finely furred with tiny absorptive hairs, make up a surface area 35 times greater than the entire surface of our planet. Microbes are collectively equivalent to 200 Earth areas... https://archive.ph/VgzKD\nAnd life may have shaped the continents by infesting the crust so much that it breaks off and sinks in the magma. More than slime we may be dry rot too!\nAnd soon to begat AI descendants to spread over the galaxy if you buy the singularity stuff.

                  "text": "The study finds that plastic bags as a fraction of the waste on beaches increased in all areas, so that’s bad.\nA more concerning issue is the nature of the bags being thrown away. California banned “single use” plastic bags (which we used to reuse as trash bags for the bathroom or whatever) but lets you buy “reusable” ones for a few cents at the checkout counter. The reusable ones are much heavier and contain 10-100x more plastic, and take even longer to biodegrade.\nThe study counts “items”, not weight, and reports a 25-47% decrease.\nAssuming California is the region that hit 47% (call it 50%), and the reusable bags are better than the best available (only 10x worse than pre-ban) that translates to a 5x increase in microplastics on the beach. I’d consider this a disaster, not a win.\nThis matches older studies, which measured total plastic content of landfill waste before and after plastic bag bans like California’s.\nThose showed sharp increases in plastic waste too. The studies in question were in places that did not allow the reusable plastic ones that California forced the stores to switch to. Instead, the authors found that people switched from using the disposable bags as trash bags to using kitchen trash bags, which are ~100x worse. If only 1% of households were using disposable shopping bags for trash, and no one reused the new style bags, then the policies ended up breaking even. In practice, the policies increased total plastic waste, despite being better thought out than California’s newer ban.\nI’m all for banning plastic bags, but the current bans target the most efficient use of plastic, increasing overall plastic production and waste. The bans should only target things that have plastic-free alternatives, or at least that have less plastic intensive alternatives.",

I'll illustrate with examples. Plastic products that aren't durable and have very short lifespans:\n- Plastic storage bins and such that use so little plastic that they break when stacked thus become plastic waste long before they ought to.\n- I bought three plastic buckets at the supermarket and the handles fell off two before I got them home. I nevertheless used them only to find that they soon cracked and leaked with normal domestic usage.\n(BTW, there's an old galvanized bucket in our family that's well over 80 years old (it belonged to my grandmother), and it's still serviceable (the galvanizing is still intact and it's not rusty).)\n- The use of polyethylene for containers, etc. Over time polyethylene leaks its plasticizers to produce a greasy coating on the surface. The polyethylene then hardens and cracks—thus more junk plastic waste. Polyethylene should not be used for such purposes.\nMoreover, phthalate plasticizers have been found to have bad effects on human health. Phthalate plasticizers ought to be banned for use in domestic products.\nI could go on, there are hundreds more examples.\nThe plastic waste problem could be fixed quick smart if high taxes were applied on plastic products that were deemed insufficiently durable.\nNo doubt, manufacturers, penny-pinching cheapskates and greedy profit mongers would cry foul over what's deemed as 'durable'. That's solvable with standards set down by an authoritative standards body.",

The article discusses three attack scenarios, including (un)marshaling unexpected data, parser differentials, and data format confusion, referencing documented vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-16250, which involved a Hashicorp Vault authentication bypass. Key technical insights include the misuse of JSON tags, such as the special `-` tag for omitting fields, which can lead to unintended data exposure if not implemented correctly. Developers are advised to use Semgrep rules to identify fields lacking proper tags and to carefully configure parsers to mitigate these risks, as demonstrated with real-world examples from popular repositories like Flipt and langchaingo.",

Currently, Cosmoe implements approximately 95% of the BeOS API, with key features like \"offscreen\" BBitmaps and BFilePanel still in development. Developers can access the source code from GitLab and test it with sample applications, though stability and compatibility remain focal points for future improvements. As noted by the creator, \"Wayland is powerful, but not friendly,\" highlighting ongoing challenges in achieving full functionality.",

Identified as RI 2394, the ship was confirmed through a meticulous 25-year archaeological study by the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM), with measurements aligning closely to historical records, including \"timbers that are almost identical to Endeavour, within millimeters,\" according to ANMM archaeologist Kieran Hosty. The ship, originally launched in 1768, was repurposed as a troop transport and scuttled to block Newport Harbour in 1778, and while artefacts are unlikely to be recovered, the findings emphasize the ship's unique features, such as its \"stem scarf.\" The discovery follows a controversial preliminary report in 2022, which faced criticism from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) for being \"premature.\"",

The attackers targeted nearly 22,000 destination ports on a single IP, utilizing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, which are favored for their speed and lack of connection establishment. This attack also incorporated reflection techniques using services like the Network Time Protocol and the Quote of the Day Protocol, with amplification factors potentially exceeding a thousandfold. Cloudflare emphasizes the importance of securing servers against such spoofed packet responses to mitigate risks.",

It cites the example of TensorFlow, where technical debt and complexity made maintenance difficult, highlighting that \"good engineers\" often left for less cumbersome projects. The author notes that tools like c2rust and Syzygy have been explored for this purpose, with Syzygy successfully producing a complete, albeit slower, implementation of a library in safe Rust. The article posits that if LLMs can effectively manage API changes and refactoring, it could transform how developers approach code maintenance and library management, potentially reducing the barriers to significant updates.",

She argues that these visuals serve as critical narrative devices that deepen the anti-war themes, urging audiences to reflect on real-world issues like global warming and conflict. Aguirre notes that the film depicts the aftermath of the apocalyptic Ceramic War, which included the deployment of biomechanical weapons known as Giant Warriors, leading to the creation of the Toxic Jungle, a poisoned environment that symbolizes the devastation of war. This analysis underscores the film's potential as an educational tool, suggesting it can help viewers, especially children, understand the importance of environmental conservation and peaceful coexistence.",

Which drives me nuts because it's the only feature from the recent AI hype wave that excites me because it's the only thing so far that sounds like it will actually make my life better. But then I thought about it a bit more and I realized that what I really want is not AI, I just want my computer to have a detailed local history and search functionality.\nMy computer should remember everything I did on it, period. It should remember every website I visited, exactly how far down I scrolled on each page, every thought I typed and subsequently deleted before posting... And it should have total recall! I should be able to rewind back to any point in time and track exactly what happened, because it's a computer. I already have a lossy memory of stuff that happened yesterday and that's inside my head. The whole point of having my computer remember stuff for me is that it's supposed to do it better than me.\nAnd I want the search to be deterministic. I want to be able to input precise timestamps and include boolean operators. Yes, it would be helpful to have fuzzy matches, recommendations and a natural language processing layer too, but Lucene et al already did that acceptably well for local datasets 20+ years ago. It's great we have a common corpus, but I don't care about getting tokenized prose from the corpus, I care about the stuff I did on my own computer!\nFrom my perspective LLMs don't bring much value on the personalized search front. The way I understand it, the nature of their encoding makes it impossible to get back the data you were actually looking for unless that data was also stored and indexed the traditional way, in which case you could have just skipped the layer of indirection and queried the source data in the first place.\nI am also curious to see how all of this develops. I get a sense that the current trend of injecting LLMs everywhere is a temporary stop-gap measure used to give people the illusion of a computer that knows everything because researchers haven't yet figured out how to actually index \"everything\" in a performant way. But for the use case of personalized search, the computer doesn't actually need to know \"everything\", it only needs to know about text that was visible on-screen, plus a bit of metadata (time period, cursor position, clipboard, URL etc). If we currently still need an LLM to index that because snapshotting the actual text and throwing it into a traditional index requires too much disk space, okay, but then what's next? Because just being able to have a vague conversation about a thing I kindasorta maybe was doing yesterday is not it. Total recall is it.",

Key improvements include the ability to handle hard constraints with infinite stiffness without numerical instabilities and improved convergence for high stiffness ratios. The method, implemented on GPU, achieves real-time performance for millions of objects with low iteration counts, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in stability and convergence, as demonstrated in the SIGGRAPH '25 presentation by Chris Giles, Elie Diaz, and Cem Yuksel.

The author expresses frustration with the lack of accessible resources for computer scientists, noting that most curricula only cover Discrete Math and Linear Algebra. The series will provide a step-by-step approach, utilizing the Rust programming language for coding examples, although it will prioritize understandability over optimization. Key applications highlighted include CRC, AES Encryption, and Reed-Solomon codes, with an emphasis on active learning and practical exercises to reinforce concepts. The author encourages readers to engage with the material and share their implementations, aiming to bridge the gap in abstract algebra education for computer scientists.",
