While \"raw\" LLMs are cool, they're annoying to use as anything but chatbots, as their output is unpredictable and basically impossible to parse programmatically.\nStructured outputs solve that problem neatly. In a way, they're \"neural networks without the training\". They can be used to solve similar problems as traditional neural networks, things like image classification or extracting information from messy text, but all they require is a Zod or Pydantic type definition and a prompt. No renting GPUs, labeling data and tuning hyperparameters necessary.\nThey often also improve LLM performance significantly. Imagine you're trying to extract calories per 100g of product, but some product give you calories per serving and a serving size, calories per pound etc. The naive way to do this is a prompt like \"give me calories per 100g\", but that forces the LLM to do arithmetic, and LLMs are bad at arithmetic. With structured outputs, you just give it the fifteen different formats that you expect to see as alternatives, and use some simple Python to turn them all into calories per 100g on the backend side.",

This initiative includes the construction of seven semiconductor fabs across mega-sites in Texas and Utah, which will create over 60,000 jobs. TI's Sherman site alone will see up to $40 billion allocated for four fabs (SM1, SM2, SM3, and SM4), with SM1 and SM2 already in progress. CEO Haviv Ilan stated, “TI is building dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity at scale,” emphasizing the critical role these chips play in various sectors, from automotive to healthcare.

It includes a hidden command for generating manpages using Mango, which enhances the appearance of documentation by utilizing roff instead of markdown. The library allows for customizable themes, supports silent usage output to improve user experience, and is easy to implement with a simple invocation of `fang.Execute` alongside a Cobra command. As part of the Charm ecosystem, Fang is open-source under the MIT license, inviting community feedback and contributions via platforms like Twitter and Discord.",

It uses Clap which is the equivalent of Cobra; though I don’t think Clap has the same kind of fancy output?\nThroughout these years, I have found that cross-compiling is the most challenging part of creating a CLI. When you are building a web back-end, you control the execution environment (usually linux). For CLIs, your users could be on Linux, macOS or Windows. You need to get three x2 binaries (so a total of 6) to have a fair coverage.\nI’ve tried cross, but for Windows and macOS you need licenses. There is no straightforward way to give your users Docker images and have them running in a few commands. You can compile on GitHub action machines, but that’s a very slow feedback loop. I wonder if things are better in Go land.\n!: https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter",

Despite being a bootstrapped venture, Base44 rapidly grew to 250,000 users, generating $189,000 in profit by May, largely through word-of-mouth and Shlomo's social media presence. The platform enables users to create applications without coding by utilizing text prompts and supports various integrations, including email and analytics. Shlomo attributed the sale to the need for scaling beyond organic growth, stating, \"the scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into,\" highlighting the potential of AI in startup productivity.",
