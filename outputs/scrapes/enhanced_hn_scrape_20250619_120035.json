Nowadays it's almost reality, almost because the devil is always in the details. When you're used to write code, writing code is relatively fast. You need this knowledge to debug issues with generated code. However you're now telling AI to fix the bugs in the generated code. I see it kind of like machine code becomes overlaid with asm which becomes overlaid with C or whatever higher level language, which then uses dogma/methodology like MVC and such and on top of that there's now the AI input and generation layer. But it's not widely available. Affording more than 1 computer is a luxury. Many households are even struggling to get by. When you see those what 5 7 Mac Minis, which normal average Joe can afford that or does even have to knowledge to construct an LLM at home? I don't. This is a toy for rich people. Just like with public clouds like AWS, GCP I left out, because the cost is too high and running my own is also too expensive and there are cheaper alternatives that not only cost less but also have way less overhead.\nWhat would be interesting to see is what those kids produced with their vibe coding.",

It emphasizes that while AI agents offer autonomy, simpler solutions often suffice for many applications, such as a resume-screening tool. For instance, an LLM can classify resumes as \"Passed\" or \"Failed\" using one-shot prompting, while RAG enhances this by integrating internal data for improved decision-making. Key insights include starting with simple workflows and only adopting AI agents when necessary, as well as prioritizing reliability over capability in production systems. Notably, the article suggests employing APIs for automation, such as connecting to email and calendar services to streamline recruitment processes.",

      "article_summary": "The Claude Code Usage Monitor is a real-time terminal tool designed for tracking Claude AI token usage, offering features such as updates every 3 seconds, visual progress bars, and smart predictions for token depletion based on current burn rates. It supports multiple plans—Pro (~7,000 tokens), Max5 (~35,000), and Max20 (~140,000)—and includes an auto-detection mode that switches to a custom limit when the Pro threshold is exceeded. Users can customize reset times and time zones, with default reset times set for every 5 hours after the first message in a session. The tool can be installed using Python 3.6+ and npm, with a simple command like `./ccusage_monitor.py --plan pro` for basic usage. As stated in the article, \"Start Early: Begin monitoring when you start a new session\" is a key actionable insight for effective management of token usage.",

TI's Sherman site alone will see up to $40 billion allocated for four fabs (SM1, SM2, SM3, and SM4), with SM1 and SM2 already in progress. CEO Haviv Ilan stated, “TI is building dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity at scale,” emphasizing the critical role these chips play in various sectors, from automotive to healthcare.

      "article_summary": "Israeli developer Maor Shlomo's vibe-coding startup, Base44, was acquired by Wix for $80 million just six months after its launch. Despite being a bootstrapped venture, Base44 rapidly grew to 250,000 users, generating $189,000 in profit by May, largely through word-of-mouth and Shlomo's social media presence. The platform enables users to create applications without coding by utilizing text prompts and supports various integrations, including email and analytics. Shlomo attributed the sale to the need for scaling beyond organic growth, stating, \"the scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into,\" highlighting the potential of AI in startup productivity.",

It underscores that \"poor documentation doesn't just frustrate human readers; it directly degrades the quality of AI responses,\" highlighting the necessity for explicit and self-contained content chunks to improve AI accuracy. Actionable insights include using standardized semantic HTML, avoiding PDFs in favor of HTML or Markdown, and ensuring semantic clarity in URLs, which collectively enhance machine readability and retrieval efficiency.",

You need to get three x2 binaries (so a total of 6) to have a fair coverage.\nI’ve tried cross, but for Windows and macOS you need licenses. There is no straightforward way to give your users Docker images and have them running in a few commands. You can compile on GitHub action machines, but that’s a very slow feedback loop.
