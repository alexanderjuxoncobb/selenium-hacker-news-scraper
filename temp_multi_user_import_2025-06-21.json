      "article_summary": "The article \"AbsenceBench: Language Models Can't Tell What's Missing,\" authored by Harvey Yiyun Fu and five others, introduces a new benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to detect missing information in texts. Despite achieving a 69.6% F1-score on the AbsenceBench tasks with an average context length of 5,000 tokens, even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet struggle significantly due to the limitations of Transformer attention mechanisms in recognizing \"gaps\" in documents. The benchmark tests LLMs across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests, highlighting a critical distinction between tasks where models excel (e.g., Needle in a Haystack) and those where they falter. The research underscores the need for improved model architectures to better handle information omissions.",

What we're currently doing with training is leaving out this understanding as \"exercise to the reader\". We're feeding correct answers to specific, individual examples which promotes memoization.\nWhat we should be doing in post training is ditch direct backpropagation on next token, instead let the model finish its wrong answer, append explanation why it's wrong and continue backpropagation for final answer - now with explanation in context to guide it to the right place in understanding.\nWhat all of this means is that current models are largely underutilized and unnecessarily bloated, they contain way too much memoized information. Making model larger is easy, quick illusion of improvement. Models need to be squeezed more, more focus needs to go towards training flow itself.",

They start at birth with competency up to about 3 or 5 and expand from that. So they can already work with quantities of varying size (i.e. they know which is more, the 4 apples on the left or the five on the right, and they also know what happens if I take one apple from the left and put it to the others on the right), and then they learn the numbers.

The reusable ones are much heavier and contain 10-100x more plastic, and take even longer to biodegrade.\nThe study counts “items”, not weight, and reports a 25-47% decrease.\nAssuming California is the region that hit 47% (call it 50%), and the reusable bags are better than the best available (only 10x worse than pre-ban) that translates to a 5x increase in microplastics on the beach. I’d consider this a disaster, not a win.\nThis matches older studies, which measured total plastic content of landfill waste before and after plastic bag bans like California’s.\nThose showed sharp increases in plastic waste too. The studies in question were in places that did not allow the reusable plastic ones that California forced the stores to switch to. Instead, the authors found that people switched from using the disposable bags as trash bags to using kitchen trash bags, which are ~100x worse. If only 1% of households were using disposable shopping bags for trash, and no one reused the new style bags, then the policies ended up breaking even. In practice, the policies increased total plastic waste, despite being better thought out than California’s newer ban.\nI’m all for banning plastic bags, but the current bans target the most efficient use of plastic, increasing overall plastic production and waste. The bans should only target things that have plastic-free alternatives, or at least that have less plastic intensive alternatives.",

Are they?\nWhere I live (Sweden) the extra plastic bag fee introduced made people also buy more single use plastic bags in bulk which were cheaper and flimsier. If they are making up a larger part of the \"items\" counted, and not the reusable bags, then the win is even greater than a 25-47% decrease.\nWhat reason do you have to believe people are throwing away the heavier, reusable bags at that rate?

I'll illustrate with examples. Plastic products that aren't durable and have very short lifespans:\n- Plastic storage bins and such that use so little plastic that they break when stacked thus become plastic waste long before they ought to.\n- I bought three plastic buckets at the supermarket and the handles fell off two before I got them home. I nevertheless used them only to find that they soon cracked and leaked with normal domestic usage.\n(BTW, there's an old galvanized bucket in our family that's well over 80 years old (it belonged to my grandmother), and it's still serviceable (the galvanizing is still intact and it's not rusty).)\n- The use of polyethylene for containers, etc. Over time polyethylene leaks its plasticizers to produce a greasy coating on the surface. The polyethylene then hardens and cracks—thus more junk plastic waste. Polyethylene should not be used for such purposes.\nMoreover, phthalate plasticizers have been found to have bad effects on human health. Phthalate plasticizers ought to be banned for use in domestic products.\nI could go on, there are hundreds more examples.\nThe plastic waste problem could be fixed quick smart if high taxes were applied on plastic products that were deemed insufficiently durable.\nNo doubt, manufacturers, penny-pinching cheapskates and greedy profit mongers would cry foul over what's deemed as 'durable'. That's solvable with standards set down by an authoritative standards body.",

Of course many traditional products are often (not always) sold in plastic like milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, breads. But, stores are full of, packaged by the store or the store's company products. The easist place to see this is the prepared foods section. Veggie salads in plastic, pasta salad in plastic, hummus in plastic, cookies in plastic, nuts in plastic, sandwiches in plastic, ...\nI have no idea what it would take to stop that and what the substitute would be. Examples: I like Japanese Milk Bread. It generally comes wrapped in a plastic bag, arguably because it's not hardy like something like sourdough which can be sold in an open paper bag.\nSimilarly, local markets sell Chinese sticky lotus leaf rice, 2 or 3 in a plastic container, they sell fresh tofu skin in a plastic container. I guess they could try to switch to waxed cardboard like milk is sometimes sold? Is that good or is that cardboard infused with plastic?\nHas any \"progressive\" country banned plastic such that pre-sliced meat/cheese is not sold in plastic?",

      "article_summary": "The wreck of Captain Cook's ship, HMS Endeavour, has been discovered off the coast of Rhode Island, where it sank 250 years ago during the American War of Independence. Identified as RI 2394, the ship was confirmed through a meticulous 25-year archaeological study by the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM), with measurements aligning closely to historical records, including \"timbers that are almost identical to Endeavour, within millimeters,\" according to ANMM archaeologist Kieran Hosty. The ship, originally launched in 1768, was repurposed as a troop transport and scuttled to block Newport Harbour in 1778, and while artefacts are unlikely to be recovered, the findings emphasize the ship's unique features, such as its \"stem scarf.\" The discovery follows a controversial preliminary report in 2022, which faced criticism from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) for being \"premature.\"",

      "article_summary": "The article draws a compelling analogy between the experiences of college baseball players and the venture capital (VC) fundraising process, emphasizing the high stakes and emotional rollercoaster involved in both. The author, reflecting on his son's journey as a college athlete, notes that \"the experience of the college athlete... looks uncannily like raising a round of venture capital.\" Key parallels include the importance of a \"pitch deck,\" which for athletes consists of performance videos shared on platforms like Twitter, and the concept of the \"Long Maybe,\" where both VCs and coaches often delay decisions, leading to uncertainty for the athlete or entrepreneur. The article highlights the non-binding nature of offers in college baseball, akin to VC term sheets, underscoring the necessity for athletes to assess the integrity of coaches—much like how investors evaluate VCs. Actionable insights include recognizing the importance of solid performance metrics and being wary of vague promises in both realms.",

Being constantly rejected, needing to be seen as more gifted than the competition and the goddamn urgency to catch on fire yesterday were the same and we got along great even if we understood and cared nothing about each other's work.\nPeople who are considering one of these paths have an opportunity to learn from folks who might not do what they do exactly, but have been in the same sort of system. To realise the relationships they're buying into, the price they'll need to pay for a shot at stardom and to think if it's really an experience they can afford.",
