The licensing issues related to video content were a major hurdle, leading to the decision to rebuild the app from scratch despite the original project being open source under the MIT license.",

The new owner stopped maintaining it, and the repo went abandoned.\nOver the next 9 months, I sent 15 emails to try to save it : no replies. Feature requests & issues were ignored. The community was left with a \"broken\" tool let's say.\nI couldn't just let it die So I built the new version from scratch with the same open-source spirit, but a better architecture long-term vision, more features and no license problems.\nIt's called : Workout.cool (https://workout.cool)\nWhat it offers:\n100% open-source, MIT-licensed\n1200+ exercises (with videos, attributes, translations)\nProgress tracking\nMultilingual-ready\nSelf-hostable\nI'm not doing this for money. I'm doing it because I believe in open fitness tools, and I’ve been passionate about strength training for 15+ years.\nIf this resonates with you, feel free to:\n- Star the repo\n- Share with fitness/tech friends\n- Suggest features\n- Contribute code/design/docs\nTogether, we can build the open-source fitness platform we all wanted to easily build a workout routine and get in shape\nWebsite: https://workout.cool GitHub: https://github.com/Snouzy/workout-cool",

That is, in fact, the whole point behind the most famous open source license, GPLv3: code is open source, but there are still restrictions on how you can use the code. I don't know about now (most projects I work on are MIT-licensed, these days), but there was rancor around the move from v2 to v3 because v3 was more restrictive.",
