      "article_summary": "In the article \"Is there a Half-Life for the Success Rates of AI Agents?\" by Toby Ord, it is revealed that AI agents exhibit an exponentially declining success rate as task duration increases, modeled by a constant failure rate per minute. Citing Kwa et al. (2025) from METR, the article notes that the task length AI can handle doubles every 7 months, based on a suite of 170 tasks, with a 50% success rate achievable for tasks up to 59 minutes but only 15 minutes for an 80% success rate. The findings suggest that each agent has a \"half-life\" defined by the time it takes a human to complete tasks, highlighting a critical insight: \"the task length for an 80% success rate is 1/4 the task length for a 50% success rate.\" This model invites further exploration of AI capabilities across diverse tasks, while acknowledging limitations in generalizability.",

Notably, at a generation length of 100K tokens, MiniMax-M1 consumes only 25% of the FLOPs compared to DeepSeek R1. In benchmark tests, the MiniMax-M1-80K model achieved a score of 96.8 on MATH-500, outperforming competitors like Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 across various complex tasks, including software engineering and long-context understanding.
