This initiative includes the construction of seven semiconductor fabs across mega-sites in Texas and Utah, which will create over 60,000 jobs. TI's Sherman site alone will see up to $40 billion allocated for four fabs (SM1, SM2, SM3, and SM4), with SM1 and SM2 already in progress. CEO Haviv Ilan stated, “TI is building dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity at scale,” emphasizing the critical role these chips play in various sectors, from automotive to healthcare. Partnerships with leading companies such as Apple, Ford, Medtronic, NVIDIA, and SpaceX highlight TI's commitment to driving innovation in American manufacturing and technology.",
