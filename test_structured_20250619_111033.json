      "article_summary": "The Claude Code Usage Monitor is a real-time terminal tool designed for tracking Claude AI token usage, offering features such as updates every 3 seconds, visual progress bars, and smart predictions for token depletion based on current burn rates. It supports multiple plans—Pro (~7,000 tokens), Max5 (~35,000), and Max20 (~140,000)—and includes an auto-detection mode that switches to a custom limit when the Pro threshold is exceeded. Users can customize reset times and time zones, with default reset times set for every 5 hours after the first message in a session. The tool can be installed using Python 3.6+ and npm, with a simple command like `./ccusage_monitor.py --plan pro` for basic usage. As stated in the article, \"Start Early: Begin monitoring when you start a new session\" is a key actionable insight for effective management of token usage.",
